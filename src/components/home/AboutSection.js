        <p className={styles.aboutInfo}>
          Eureka College was built under the foundations of <Link href="#" className={styles.link1}>Footprints Nursing
          Review Center</Link> which is a review center for internationally educated
          nurses. We have a deep understanding of the challenges that IENs face
          when transitioning into Canadian nursing, and we work tirelessly to
          provide the guidance and support that they need to succeed.
